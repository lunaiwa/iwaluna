It is common in working with files to refer to file formats as Image formats, Audio formats, and Video formats, all of these are often called ***Binary File formats**.   In Web Application like Chrome, Safari, Edge they all focus on the usage of HTTP, or text file display like HTML.  Thus, [base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) utilities convert binary encoded data (8-bit, ASCII/Unicode/Number abstractions) into a text encoded scheme 0f (24 bits, 6-bit Base64 digits).  Thus base64 is used to transport and embed binary images into textual assets such as HTML and CSS.\n",
